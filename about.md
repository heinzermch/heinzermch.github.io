# About me

After toying with the idea of writing a blog about technical topics for various years, I've finally made it happen. Before I was busy studying Computer Science and Mathematics, finishing my studies with a master from ETH Zurich in the latter. My professional experience includes writing trading software for a hedge fund in Switzerland as well as conducting deep learning research for Panasonic in California. Currently, I am training, testing and deploying small models on mobile phones for a Computer Vision startup in Zurich.
