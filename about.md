# About me

After toying with the idea of writing a blog about technical topics for various years, it looks like I've finally made it happen. Before I was busy studying Computer Science and Mathematics, finishing my studies with a master from [ETH Zurich](https://math.ethz.ch/) in the latter. My professional experience includes writing trading software for a [hedge fund](http://www.stonemilliner.com/) in Switzerland and conducting deep learning research for [Panasonic](https://www.panasonic.com/global/corporate/technology-design/r-and-d.html) in California. Currently, I am training, testing and deploying small models on mobile phones for a Computer Vision [startup](https://www.scandit.com/) in Zurich.

If you would like to contact me, feel free do add me on LinkedIn or write an email to [my github name]@gmail.com
