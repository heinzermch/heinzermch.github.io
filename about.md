# About me

After toying with the idea of writing a blog about technical topics for various years, it looks like I've finally made it happen. My educational background is Computer Science and Mathematics, finishing my studies with a master from [ETH Zurich](https://math.ethz.ch/) in the latter. 

My professional experience includes writing trading software for a ([now defunct](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-26/moore-spinoff-stone-milliner-to-shutter-its-macro-hedge-fund)) hedge fund in Switzerland and conducting deep learning research for [Panasonic](https://www.panasonic.com/global/corporate/technology-design/r-and-d.html) in California. After that I was training, testing and deploying small models on mobile phones for a Computer Vision [startup](https://www.scandit.com/). Currently I'm working on multimodal machine learning and ranking for SafeSearch at [Google Zurich](https://about.google/intl/ALL_ch/around-the-globe/local-info/) in Zurich.

When I'm not thinking about ML problems I like to run, hike and fly [FPV drones](https://www.youtube.com/@michaelontherun/videos), preferrably in the mountains.

If you would like to contact me, feel free do add me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/heinzerm) or write an email to [my github name]@gmail.com
